# Java Spring API and React Hooks

## Tech Used
- Spring Data JPA API or Star Wars API 
- React
    - Hooks
    - React Router
    - Axios
- CSS Modules

## In this workshop you will ...
- Render data from a Spring Application in React
- Create Functional Components that utilize React Hooks to bring in your data and manage state
- Use Ternary Operators and Loading Spinners for Conditional Rendering 
- Use React Router to create customized endpoints in your Single Page Application
- Style your application with CSS Modules 

## How to work with this application 
- clone the application: `https://github.com/AlanKostrick/java-react-demo.git`
- cd into `server-side` if you want the Java API otherwise you can use the Star Wars API we will be able to use both during the workshop
- running in IntelliJ will spin up a backend server at `localhost:8080`
- cd into `client-side`
- run `npm install`
- if you use vs code you can open with `code .` 
- run the terminal in vs code and key in `npm start` to fire the server at `localhost:3000`

We will be working in `react-demo/client-side/src/pages/campuses-screen/index.js` and `react-demo/client-side/src/pages/star-wars-people-screen/index.js` together

## Installation Video Link
(Note: It would be as helpful as possible for us to get started on the code and have the project installed prior to the workshop... if the Java/Eclipse backend does not work or is not something you have a history of working with no problem there as I have built in a reference to the Star Wars API and you would only need to worry about installing the Client side code in that case)
